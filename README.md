  - Ctrl+Click to follow namespaced ID under cursor;
  - Accept user-defined command syntaxes;

  - Predicate, loot table and item modifier editors (inspired by the [misode's generator](https://misode.github.io/ "misode's generator")).
- View images (such as the pack.png) directly in the program.
- Other useful tools:
   - Statistics of file and command usage in a datapack;
